  Description    : Interface for the command class
  Purpose        : The Command class represents a command object
  Modifications  : 

  Notes:
  This header file provides the interface to the Command class, as well as to
  a few types that are required in order to use this class, specifically the 
  following enumerated types:
    Command_type
    Boro_type
  All of the member functions required to utilize this class are here. 
  There is no need to modify this class and it should not be modified!

/** Command_type: 
    An enumerated type to represent the different types of commands. This is  
    more efficient than storing command types as strings. Notice that the last
    value of the type is num_Command_types, which is simply a count of how many
    values the type contains. It is a useful method of counting, because as long
    as you insert new values before it, it remains valid.
